# Feature-Engineering
Why should we use Feature Engineering in data science?
In Data Science, the performance of the model is depending on data preprocessing and data handling. Suppose if we build a model without Handling data, we got an accuracy of around 70%. By applying the Feature engineering on the same model there is a chance to increase the performance from 70% to more.

Simply, by using Feature Engineering we improve the performance of the model.
